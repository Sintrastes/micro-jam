# micro-jam

So, you just got your first guitar refretted to some far out temperament -- maybe you've started practicing and learning some new and interesting scale and chord shapes using [xen-fret](https://github.com/Sintrastes/xen-fret). You want to take the next step and test out the new melodic potential of your instrument, and figure out how to solo over some xen chord changes -- but alas, nobody has made any jam tracks for [17-EDT](https://en.xen.wiki/w/17edt) (how dare they!) -- and you're still learning this new system, so making your own is going to be a lot of effort.

...But not anymore -- introducing micro-jam!

micro-jam gives you a quick and dirty way to choose a few chord changes, and choose from a number of built-in rhythmic styles, and given this will automatically generate a backing track for you in whatever <s>weird-ass</s> awesome temperament your heart desires.

# installation

micro-jam is just an idea right now, so sadly you cannot install it yet. :(
